# python-noodling
## Overview
This activity was my first exposure to Python! Completed as a module assignment for the Monash Uni Data Analytics and Visualisation Bootcamp, it contains two separate activities (PyPoll and PyBank) that involve:
- reading in .csvs;
- using loops to append to empty lists;
- creating running totals and counts;
- using basic list comprehensions;
- writing to .txt.
